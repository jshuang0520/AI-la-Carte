TODO

for Johnson:
1. add google docs questions
2. use miles for dist
3. copy geo_helper.py from Peeyush's branch
4. collect user info - backend input or worst case, frontend dropdown list


Would you like to get food today or another day this week? 
(Follow up: If another day, what day?)
Filter nearby sites by days of operation based on client preference. Interpret the week of the month field to know which distributions will be happening soonest.


What time of day would you like to pick up food?
Filter by hours of operation and see who is open on those hours of the day. 



output for further workflow:
Mar 24 Mon morning
Mar 24 Mon afternoon
Mar 25 Tue night
Mar 26 Wed evening

we need to pre-define the following time slot by our own: 
morning: 06:00 ~ 12:00, 
afternoon: 12:00 ~ 17:00, 
evening: 17:00 ~ 19:00, 
night: 19:00 ~ 00:00
