I don't get it, why there are so many sets of configs (multiple xxx_config.py and xxx_config.yaml) and envs?
I mean, come on, there should be a config parser class to parse all kinds of configs (under src directory)
and one config.yaml template, to have all kinds of variables as keys, and placeholders for different values from different environments (that's where env files comes in)
so that in the main file, for example, it can use the config parser to parse the injected corresponding values from each environment from the config template (env files)
please integrate the above mentioned
